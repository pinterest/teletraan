-- ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCRIPT   
-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This dir contains scripts to upgrade db schema to the latest version. Simply execute:
./upgrade.sh [-H|--host HOST] [-P|--port PORT] [-u|--user USERNAME] [-p|--password PASSWORD] [-d|--database DATABASE]
It will upgrade db schema from the current version to the latest.

In any case if the upgrade failed, you would have to look at all the schema-update-* files and manually apply the changes,
and then update the version in database_schemas table to be the latest.

We do not support rollback yet.

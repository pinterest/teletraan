      <p>
      If you are not in the Ads org, you need a special approval for *any change* to production. You can ask for that approval by emailing changefreeze@. The approval is unlikely to be granted if this is not a change in one of the given categories.

      If you are working in Ads, there are a few very specific approvals given by default, for any other changes, the process is the same.
